## Trashpocalypse

>The year is 2169. 109 years ago the world as we know it came to an end by the event of Thrashpocalypse. From the continent of garbage came a new virus that infected 90% of the human civilization turning them into thrash-like mutants simply known as the Wasted. After our mysterious main character Scavenger receives help from an abnormal mutant he receives the means and the knowledge to fight the unending waves of the Wasted and bring an end to the Wastelands.  

In this platformer shooter game you are tasked to fight the Wasted. But be aware. Certain types of wasted are weak to certain weapons so be sure to use the right ones. Using the wrong weapon will do less or even no damage.
